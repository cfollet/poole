# Poole

This is an alternative version of the excellent [Poole](https://github.com/poole/poole) theme for [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/).
I made this for my [personal blog](https://cfollet.github.io) and to include more functionalities such as :

* [Disqus](https://disqus.com/) comments
* Post read time
* Section anchor
* Social sharing

I also made various typographic modifications inspired by the websites of [Mark Dotto](http://markdotto.com/), [Zeno Rocha](https://zenorocha.com/), [Matthiew Butterick](http://practicaltypography.com/).
